1. Introduction
--------------------------------

GNOME Commander is a fast and powerful twin-panel file manager for the GNOME desktop.

Read the sections "FAQ" and "Known problems" to see if there are some known
problems with the version you are using. The TODO file might also contain
some clues when running into problems.

The ChangeLog contains a detailed description on what has changed. For most
users the NEWS file might be a better place to look since it contains
change summaries between the different versions.

GNOME Commander is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2,
see the file 'COPYING' for more information.

The official web site is:

    http://www.nongnu.org/gcmd/

You can download the latest GNOME Commander tarball from the gnome ftp server:

2. Contributing
--------------------------------

Ideas:
  If have some good ideas for stuff that you want to see in this program you
  should check the TODO file first before sending email. After that you're
  welcome to start a discussion on the mailing lists.

Translations:
  * Since now this program is in the GNOME git repository, translations should be
    commited directly to the tree there.

Cool hacks:
  * Send an email with the patch to the developers mailing list.
  * Please use the -u flag when generating the patch as it makes the patch
    more readable.
  * Write a good explanation of what the patch does.

Plugins:
  * If you have created a new plugin let us know about it on the mailing list.



3. Building
--------------------------------

GNOME Commander requires glib >= 2.6.0, GTK+ >= 2.8.0 and gnome >= 2.4.0 libraries.

Additionally GNOME Commander may require:

  * gnome-vfs >= 2.0.0
    Used for most of the file handling. If gnome-vfs is built to use fam
    gnome-commander makes use of that functionality by being able to update
    its visible directories even when files are create/deleted or changed by
    other programs.

  * python >= 2.4
    Optional - for python plugins support.

  * exiv2 >= 0.14
    Optional - for Exif and IPTC support.

  * taglib >= 1.4
    Optional - for ID3, Vorbis, FLAC and APE support.

  * libgsf >= 1.12.0
    Optional - for OLE and ODF support.

  * poppler >= 0.6
    Optional - for PDF support.


Simple install procedure:

  % gzip -cd gnome-commander-1.2.8.3.tar.gz | tar xvf - 	# unpack the sources
  % cd gnome-commander-1.2.8.3		# change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure							# run the `configure' script
  % make								# build GNOME Commander
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install						# install GNOME Commander

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.


4. Communication
--------------------------------

This project has two mailing lists, one for users and one for developers.
Subscription to those mailing lists can be done at:

users: http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-users
devel: http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-devel

You can also find email addresses of the people who have created gnome-commander
in the AUTHORS file.


5. Problem reporting
--------------------------------

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gnome-commander). You will need to create an
account for yourself.

You can also report bugs using the GNOME program bug-buddy.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and gnome libraries
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stack trace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.

See the file 'BUGS' for the list of known bugs.
